BETTER WEATHER RNG v1.0.0 author: zupercb

NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS:
KOVACS: used the "Less Intense Weather" mod for the default weather settings.
KAZIUS: for the mod idea

OVERVIEW: A simple mod that replaces the current weather settings that was originally packaged by default, and added more weather entries to propel the RNG in favour of more pleasing game weather. Once unzipped in appropriate folder and the server cache is deleted and re-cached, it will create a new cache with the new weather entries as well.

INSTALL
unzip files towards \Server\db\weather
delete & recache server

NOTES
tested on JET Server 1.0.0 to 1.0.3
didn't thouroughly check this but the weather icon could be incorrectly representing in-game weather types on some instances.
