BETTER WEATHER RNG v1.0.0 author: zupercb

NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS:
KOVACS: used the "Less Intense Weather" mod for the default weather settings.
KAZIUS: for the mod idea

OVERVIEW: A simple mod that replaces the current weather settings that was originally packaged by default, and added more weather entries to propel the RNG in favour of more pleasing game weather. Once unzipped in appropriate folder, delete current server cache and re-cached (automatic when re-starting server), the new weather entries will be added as well.

INSTALL
unzip files towards \Server\db\weather,
then delete & recache server

NOTES
tested on JET Server 1.0.0 to 1.0.3
didn't thoroughly check this but the weather icon could be incorrectly representing in-game weather types on some instances.
